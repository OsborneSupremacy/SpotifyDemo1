# SPOTIFY DEMO

Just playing around with the Spotify API.

Client ID and Client Secret need to go in `appsettings.json`. Get them by registering an app [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

## API REFERENCE

<https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/>

## Spotify user IDs

Spotify does not allow usernames to be looked up by email address. A user can find their ID in the Spotify app by going to Settings --> Account.

Spotify does allow public playlists to be queried, and in those public playlists, usernames can be viewed. I found these usernames by querying public playlists. They can be used to test this application.
